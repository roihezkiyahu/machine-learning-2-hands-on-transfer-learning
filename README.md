# Machine Learning with Transfer Learning

This repository contains a solution to an exercise from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow". The exercise focuses on the concept of transfer learning, a machine learning method where a pre-trained model is used on a new problem.

You can view the implementation on Kaggle: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/roihezkiyahu/cats-vs-dogs-transfer-learning-hands-on-ml-ex14-10)

## Project Overview

The exercise involves using the Cats and Dogs dataset to implement a transfer learning model. The model is trained to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Implementation

The implementation of the exercise can be found in the Jupyter notebook: [cats-vs-dogs-transfer-learning-hands-on-ml-ex14-10.ipynb](cats-vs-dogs-transfer-learning-hands-on-ml-ex14-10.ipynb).
